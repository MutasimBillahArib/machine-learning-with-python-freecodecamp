# 🎓 Machine Learning with Python Certification

Welcome to my **Machine Learning with Python Certification** repository!  

This repository contains the five projects I completed as part of the **Machine Learning with Python Certification** offered by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/). Each project explores different areas of applied machine learning—from traditional algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors to deep learning techniques for image and text classification.
